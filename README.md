## Weighted session-based k-NN - Intro

Do you build a recommender system for your website? K-nearest neighbors algorithm is a good choice if you are looking for a simple, fast, and explainable solution. Weighted-session-based k-nn recommendations are close to the state-of-the-art, and we don't need to tune multiple hyperparameters and build complex deep learning models to achieve a good result.

### How does it work?

You provide two input structures as **training** data:

```
sessions : dict
               sessions = {
                   session id: (
                       [sequence of items with user interaction],
                       [timestamp of user interaction per item],
                       [(optional) sequence of event names],
                       [(optional) sequence of weights]
                   )
               }

items : dict
        items = {
            item id: (
                [sequence of sessions with an item],
                [the first timestamp of each session with an item]
            )
        }
```

And you ask a model to recommend products based on the user session:

```
user session: 
    {session id:
        [[sequence of items], [sequence of timestamps], [optional event names], [optional weights]]
    }
```

The package is lightweight. It depends only on the `numpy` and `pyyaml`. 

Moreover, we can provide a package for non-programmers, and they can use `settings.yaml` to control a model behavior.


### Why should we use WSKNN?

- training is faster than deep learning or XGBoost algorithms, model memorizes map of session-items and item-sessions,
- recommendations are easy to control. We can change how the algorithm works in just a few lines... of text,
- as a baseline, for comparison of deep learning / XGBoost architectures,
- swift prototyping,
- easy to run in production.

The model was created along with multiple other approaches: based on RNN (GRU/LSTM), matrix factorization, and others. Its performance was always very close to the level of fine-tuned neural networks, but it was much easier and faster to train.

### What are the limitations of WSKNN?

- model memorizes session-items and item-sessions maps, and if your product base is large and you use sessions for an extended period, then the model may be too big to fit an available memory; in this case, you can 
categorize products and train a different model for each category,
- response time may be slower than from other models, especially if there are available many sessions,
- there's additional overhead related to the preparation of the input.

### Example

```python

from wsknn import fit
from wsknn.utils import load_pickled

# Load data
ITEMS = 'demo-data/items.pkl'
SESSIONS = 'demo-data/sessions.pkl'

items = load_pickled(ITEMS)
sessions = load_pickled(SESSIONS)

trained_model = fit(sessions, items)

test_session = {'unique id': [
    ['product id 1', 'product id 2'],
    ['timestamp #1', 'timestamp #2']
]}

recommendations = trained_model.recommend(test_session, number_of_recommendations=3)
print(recommendations)

```

Output:

```shell
[
 ('product id 3', 0.7),
 ('product id 4', 0.33),
 ('product id 5', 0.059)
]
```


## Setup

Version 0.1 of a package can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install wsknn
```

It works with Python versions greater or equal to 3.6.

## Requirements

| Package Version | Python versions | Other packages |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 0.1+            | 3.6+            | numpy, yaml    |
