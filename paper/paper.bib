abstract = {Session-based recommenders, used for making predictions out of users’ uninterrupted sequences of actions, are attractive for many applications. Here, for this task we propose using metric learning, where a common embedding space for sessions and items is created, and distance measures dissimilarity between the provided sequence of users’ events and the next action. We discuss and compare metric learning approaches to commonly used learning-to-rank methods, where some synergies exist. We propose a simple architecture for problem analysis and demonstrate that neither extensively big nor deep architectures are necessary in order to outperform existing methods. The experimental results against strong baselines on four datasets are provided with an ablation study.},

abstract={Recommender systems help users find relevant items of interest, for example on e-commerce or media streaming sites. Most academic research is concerned with approaches that personalize the recommendations according to long-term user profiles. In many real-world applications, however, such long-term profiles often do not exist and recommendations therefore have to be made solely based on the observed behavior of a user during an ongoing session. Given the high practical relevance of the problem, an increased interest in this problem can be observed in recent years, leading to a number of proposals for session-based recommendation algorithms that typically aim to predict the user's immediate next actions. In this work, we present the results of an in-depth performance comparison of a number of such algorithms, using a variety of datasets and evaluation measures. Our comparison includes the most recent approaches based on recurrent neural networks like gru4rec, factorized Markov model approaches such as fism or fossil, as well as simpler methods based, e.g., on nearest neighbor schemes. Our experiments reveal that algorithms of this latter class, despite their sometimes almost trivial nature, often perform equally well or significantly better than today's more complex approaches based on deep neural networks. Our results therefore suggest that there is substantial room for improvement regarding the development of more sophisticated session-based recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {The 2015 ACM Recommender Systems Challenge offered the opportunity to work on a large-scale e-commerce dataset from a big retailer in Europe which is accepting recommender system as a service from YOOCHOOSE. Participants tackled the problem of predicting what items a user intends to purchase, if any, given a click sequence performed during an activity session on the e-commerce website. The challenge ran for seven months and was very successful, attracting 850 teams from 49 countries which submitted a total of 5,437 solutions. The winners of the challenge scored approximately 50% of the maximum score, which we considered as an impressive achievement. In this paper we provide a brief overview of the challenge and its results.},
